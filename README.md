# polybar-spotify with cache

I modified this [polybar-spotify](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify) to cache the output of playerctl. The string scrolls as fast as specified in zscroll.

## Setup

Edit `spotify_status_vars` to match your environment.

See [here](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
